    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome to *Intro to Python Coding!*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introduction to the Python programming language that I’m teaching on behalf of [Computer Coach Training Center](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) on Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., starting Monday, July 13th and ending Wednesday, August 12th.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What’s this course about?\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is an introduction to the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is firmly in the [TIOBE Programming Language Index’s top 10 programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) — as I write this in July 2020, it’s in the number 3 position, behind C and Java. It’s versatile enough to have a wide array of uses, from scripting for simple tasks to [powering Instagram, Spotify, Netflix, Dropbox, and more](https://insights.daffodilsw.com/blog/top-10-applications-built-using-python). Its combination of simplicity and vast scientific and math libraries have made it the preferred programming language for [data science](https://marutitech.com/python-data-science/) and [machine learning](https://www.dexlabanalytics.com/blog/why-python-is-preferred-in-ai-and-machine-learning). [**If you’re looking for a first programming language, Python is an excellent choice**](https://mikkegoes.com/5-reasons-why-python-is-a-great-first-programming-language/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a passive course! This isn’t the kind of course where the instructor lectures over slides while you take notes (or pretend to take notes while surfing the web or checking your social media feeds). In this course, you’ll be actively taking part in the learning process, entering code, experimenting, making mistakes, correcting those mistakes, and producing working applications. You will learn by doing. At the end of each session, you’ll have a collection of little Python programs that you wrote, and which you can use as the basis for your own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course will start at the most basic level by walking you through the process of downloading and installing the necessary tools to start Python programming. From there, you’ll learn the building blocks of the Python programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Control structures** that determine what your programs do,\n",
    "* **Data structures** to store the information that your programs act on,\n",
    "* **Functions and objects** to organize your code, and\n",
    "* Using **libraries** as building blocks for your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll write all sorts of programs…\n",
    "\n",
    "* You’ll **use Python in “immediate mode” to perform quick calculations** (and you’ll sharpen your command-line skills in the process).\n",
    "* You’ll write **scripts to simplify or automate tedious tasks.**\n",
    "* You’ll build **web applications.**\n",
    "* And since it’s a networked, data-driven world where no application is an island, **you’ll learn how to use Python to interact with web services and databases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Better still, you’ll learn how to think like a programmer. You’ll learn how to look at a goal and learn how you could write a program to meet it, and how that program could be improved or enhanced. **You’ll learn skills that will serve you well as you take up other programming languages, and even learn a little bit about the inner workings of computers, operating systems, and the internet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your instructor, Joey deVilla\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m **Joey deVilla,** your instructor. I learned Python programming in 1999 during the “down time” during that year’s edition of the [Burning Man](https://burningman.org/) festival — basically a big party in a desert in Nevada — on a laptop that you would find staggeringly and hilariously slow by today’s standards. I had to learn it under such weird conditions because the job I was starting on the following week required me to be proficient in it. My point in telling this story is that any programming language that you can learn in an insanely distracting environment like Burning Man has *got* to be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to reach me, the best way to do so is on the course’s Slack channel. You can also contact me via email at [joey@joeydevilla.com](mailto:joey@joeydevilla.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to know more about me? You can check my “technology and Tampa Bay” blog, [***Global Nerdy,***](http://www.globalnerdy.com/) or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeydevilla/).\n",

    "## What you’ll need to start the course\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "**You need a computer that was made sometime in the last ten to twelve years running macOS, Windows, or Linux.** My main computer is a 2014-era MacBook Pro, but I’ll be doing demonstrations on a 2012-era Lenovo ThinkPad running Linux Mint, a 2009-era Compaq laptop running Peppermint Linux, and a Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an online course, so the computer should be connected to the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes software to write software. In order to get started with this course, you’ll need to install two key pieces of software: **Anaconda Individual Edition** and **Visual Studio Code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda Individual Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/01/anaconda_logo.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make life easier, we’ll all install the same version of Python on our computers using [**Anaconda Individual Edition**](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a software package that bundles Python with a lot of useful data science utilities, including Jupyter Notebooks, which we'll use in this course. It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Anaconda Individual Edition, navigate to [the Downloads section of the Anaconda Individual Edition page,](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) and choose the **Python 3.7 installer** (*not* the Python 2.7 installer) for your operating system. Run the installer and follow the instructions it displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've run the installer and it's finished doing its job, confirm that Python was installed by opening a terminal (on macOS and Linux) or opening Command Line (on Windows) and entering the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python --version`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your computer should provide a response that says that you're running Python 3.7.6:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/01/check_python_version.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/01/visual_studio_code.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, to make life easier, we’ll all use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our code editor. Like Anaconda, It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Visual Studio code, navigate to [the Visual Studio Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You should see a “Download” button on the page. Tap it to download the installer.\n",
