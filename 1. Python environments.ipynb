    "## The Python command-line interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python command line interpreter, **python**, has two modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interactive mode**, where you type in Python code, and the interpreter responds immediately.\n",
    "* **Batch mode**, where you give the interpreter the name of a Python file (their filenames typically have the filename extension **.py**), and the interpreter runs the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive mode\n",
    "To try out Python in interactive mode, go into your operating system’s command line (on Windows, open **Powershell** or **Command Prompt**; on macOS or Linux, open **Terminal**) and enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll be greeted by a message that will look similar to this (the exact details will vary depending on the version of Python you installed, and you operating system):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python 3.8.3 (default, Jul  2 2020, 11:26:31)\n",
    "[Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately after the message, you’ll see this, along with a flashing cursor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `>>>` is a **prompt**. It’s a cue, telling you that it’s your turn to enter something. The Python interpreter will do its best to follow your instructions or perform your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try entering the following at the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initiate self-destruct\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will respond with this message, and then provide another prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "    Initiate self-destruct\n",
    "             ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python just responded with an **error message**. In fact, it responded with a fairly common error message — `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`. “Syntax error” is a computer science term that means “What you just told me doesn’t make any sense”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try something that Python *will* understand. Enter the following at the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2 + 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python responds with this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python understood `2 + 3` as an **expression**, which is a line of code that results in a value. `2 + 3` is an expression, because if you do the math, it results in a value of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying the following math expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subtraction: `10 - 8`\n",
    "* Multiplication: `4 * 5`\n",
    "* Division: `9 / 3`\n",
    "* Modulo (a.k.a. “remainder”):\n",
    "    * The remainder you get if you divide 9 by 3: `9 % 3`\n",
    "    * The remainder you get if you divide 10 by 3: `10 % 3`\n",
    "    * The remainder you get if you divide 10 by 3: `11 % 3`\n",
    "* Exponentiation:\n",
    "    * 2 to the power of 4: `2 ** 4`\n",
    "    * 2 to the power of 5: `2 ** 5`\n",
    "    * 2 to the power of 6: `2 ** 6`\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let’s try another type of command that Python understands. Enter the following at the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Initiating self destruct. 5-4-3-2-1-BOOM!!!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python responds with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initiating self destruct. 5-4-3-2-1-BOOM!!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`print` is a **function**, which is one or more lines of code that has been grouped together and given a name. Grouping lines of code together in functions is one of the basic orgnaizing principles of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python understood `print(\"Initiating self destruct. 5-4-3-2-1-BOOM!!!\")` as a **statement**, which is a line of code that *doesn’t* result in a value, but instead results in some kind of action being carried out. `2 + 3` is an expression, because if you do the math, it results in a value of 5. `print(\"Initiating self destruct. 5-4-3-2-1-BOOM!!!\")` resulted in Python printing out the text *Initiating self destruct. 5-4-3-2-1-BOOM!!!* to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs, as you’ll soon find out, are made of a combination of expressions and statements.\n",

    "Once you’re done marvelling at the web page’s late 1990s design, click on the “Click here to get challenged” link and then see if you can figure out the first challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exiting Python’s interactive mode\n",
    "\n",
    "To get out of Python’s interactive mode, you can do either of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enter `quit()` at the command prompt.\n",
    "* Type **control-d** at the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch mode\n",
    "\n",
    "To try out Python in batch mode, you’ll need to create a Python file first. Open your favorite code editor — for this course, the official code editor is Microsoft’s [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), create a new file, and enter the following into that file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Welcome to my first Python script!\")\n",
    "print(\"Now initiating self-destruct.\")\n",
    "print(\"5... 4... 3... 2... 1...\")\n",
    "print(\"BOOM!\")\n",
    "print(\"Okay, I'm done now.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file as **first.py** and make a note of where you saved the file. You’ll notice that Visual Studio Code has various parts of the code. That’s because it recognizes `print` as a function, and stuff in quotes as text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the command line, navigate to the directory where you saved **first.py**. Then enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python first.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter will execute the code in the file, and you’ll see the following on the command line in response:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Welcome to my first Python script!\n",
    "Now initiating self-destruct.\n",
    "5... 4... 3... 2... 1...\n",
    "BOOM!\n",
    "Okay, I'm done now.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The file **python.py** is referred to as a **Python program** or a **Python script**. They both mean the same thing: A file of Python code that the Python interpreter is meant to execute."

    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are documents that can contain two kinds of content:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rich text** elements, which include things like formatted text, hyperlinks, tables, images, and similar things that you might expect to find in a document.\n",
    "2. **Code** elements, such as Python code, which are running programs that perform calculations and can display output in text or graphic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining rich text and code, Jupyter Notebooks make it possible to create documents that combine narrative, information, and interactivity.  They’re often used to run code on data, display that code’s results, and then back up those results with explanations, formulas, charts. This makes for research that’s easier to understand, transparent, shareable, and repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are part of data science at companies worldwide. For an example of companies using them, check out this article in *The Netflix Tech Blog*: [***Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a couple of ways to start up Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The GUI way:** Launch **Anaconda-Navigator** using your GUI. You’ll be presented with a number of applications, one of which is Jupyter Notebook. Click its **Launch** button.\n",
    "* **The command line way:** Enter `jupyter notebook` on the command line.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a new notebook by clicking **New** button near the upper-right corner of the page:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/01/jupyter_01.png\" />\n",

    "**Running** a cell means different things for different types of cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Running a code cell means executing the code inside it.\n",
    "* Running a text cell means rendering the formatted text inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run a cell by selecting it and then doing one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clicking the **Run** button, located near the center top of the page, just below the menu bar.\n",
    "* Pressing **Shift** and **Enter**/**Return** simultaenously.\n",
